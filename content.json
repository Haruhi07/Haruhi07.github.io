I focus on reducing hallucinations in summaries and improving the faithfulness/factuality of summarisation models. Current neural summariser has achieved significant success in generating fluent summaries, but sometimes the summariser degenerates to a language model and makes up false facts, which makes the summary less applicable in practice. I am interested in how to avoid this degeneration for summrisers and how to enable the summariser to detect and correct the hallucinations automatically.
